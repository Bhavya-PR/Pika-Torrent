## Development

See [docs/development.md](./docs/development.md)

## Upgrade to >= v0.10.0

PikaTorrent has been rewritten from scratch for v0.10.0. If you already use a previous release, upgrading to v0.10.0 will most likely not display your previous torrents.

If you want to migrate your torrents :

- Windows: Copy `%APPDATA%\pikatorrent\Config\transmission` to `%APPDATA%\pikatorrent\com.pikatorrent\PikaTorrent`)
- Linux: Copy `~/.config/pikatorrent/transmission` to `~/.local/share/pikatorrent/transmission`)

After that, It's probably safe to remove these folders :

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\pikatorrent`
- Linux: `~/.config/pikatorrent`

## Localization

PikaTorrent will soon be available in multiple languages. You will be able to contribute through weblate.
